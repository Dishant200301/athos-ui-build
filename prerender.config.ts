/**
 * PRERENDER CONFIGURATION
 * 
 * This file defines which routes should be statically prerendered for SEO.
 * Each route will generate a static HTML file with full content visible to:
 * - Search engines (Google, Bing, etc.)
 * - Web scrapers
 * - Social media bots (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn)
 * 
 * WHY: Client-side React apps render empty HTML by default.
 * This configuration ensures real HTML content is generated at build time.
